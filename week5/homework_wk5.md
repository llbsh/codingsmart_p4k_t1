# Homework for Week 5

## Task – Temperature Monitor

### Software Requirement

* Build a temperature monitor device which can track max temperature, min temperature and average temperature.
* When button_a is pressed, LED display scrolls these min/max/average values. 
* When you press button b, you start a new monitoring session, so that the previous min/max/average values are cleared.
* Add an alarm feature, when the monitor detects a high temperature ( > 70’C ). So that micro:bit can help people avoid getting burned.

### Instruction

Note: Micro:bit can could be damaged by water and high temperature ( over 120’C), as a result please take care of your micro:bit when you do your experiment. 
Learn to use LED matrix to indicate temperature values, see [this document](https://microbit-challenges.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/display.html#advanced-functions)
