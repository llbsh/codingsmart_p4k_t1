# Homework for Week 3

## Task - Make a funky music player

Design your own music player, as a minimum requirement:

* The music player should be able to play more than two songs.
* You can make it start / stop.

### Instruction

This is a little project that you can include  micro:bit functions that we have learned in the past few weeks - LED, Accelerometer, Buttons.

If you have some ideas beyond the content we covered in class, you will have to do some research by reading online documents and discover micro:bit functions in more details.
